# DevSecOps Git Workshop

## PRE-WORKSHOP FUN (20 mins)

1. Sign up for a Github account

2. Secure your account with [2FA](https://help.github.com/articles/securing-your-account-with-two-factor-authentication-2fa/). **This is an awesome security feature and you should always use 2FA. Plus, it's required for some repositories.**

3. [Git on your machine - various ways for various OS](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

4. We are eventually going to use the git **CLI**, not GUI
  
5. Generate a SSH key so we can do a `git clone`

   - [Instructions Here](https://help.github.com/articles/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent)
